.SYNOPSIS
    Publishes ClaudeStatus and builds the Velopack installer.

.DESCRIPTION
    The whole of the release build, in one script that CI and a developer run
    identically. Nothing here is GitHub-specific: `./build/pack.ps1 -Version 1.2.3`
    on a laptop produces the same artifacts the release workflow uploads, which is
    the only way a packaging problem gets found before a tag exists rather than
    after.

.PARAMETER Version
    The version to stamp, without a leading "v".

    Passed explicitly rather than left to MinVer because semantic-release computes
    the next version and creates the tag AFTER running this script. MinVer would
    read the previous tag and every release would ship stamped one version behind.

.PARAMETER Runtime
    The .NET RID to build. Only win-x64 is released today; the script has no
    Windows-specific logic, so adding a RID is a workflow change.

.PARAMETER OutputDir
    Where the installer and packages are written.

.EXAMPLE
    ./build/pack.ps1 -Version 0.1.0
